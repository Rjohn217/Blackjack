# This is a BlackJack game created in Java using a simple command-line interface. 
# The player starts out with $100 and plays against the dealer. 
# The dealer always hits on 17. 
# Normal BlackJack logic applies to this game, with the player winning if their deck value is greater than that of the dealer's deck value, or losing if their deck value is greater than 21.
